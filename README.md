# Simple CRUD with React and Express.js

This is a simple CRUD application using React and Express.js. It is a full-stack application that includes both frontend and backend parts.
This is a simple example of how to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using [React](https://react)
And also this project was created to enhance my programming skills in the MERN stack ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://react), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)). I hope you like it :)
